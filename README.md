# The Effects of Public Education Expenditure on Household Education Expenditure
## Abstract

We attempt to determine the relationship between public education investment and household education expenditure, is it irrelavant, substitutive or complementary. The result shows that the increase of public education investment leads to an increase in household education expenditure, which is also called the crowd-in effect. 

Generally speaking, public education investment has a crowd-in effect on family education expenditure. Firstly, the increase in public education investment leads to the decrease in household education investment. Second, the result shows a more crowd-in effect on urban family education investment, especially when the children are in compulsory education stage.
