# The Effects of Public Education Expenditure on Household Education Expenditure
## Abstract

We attempt to determine the relationship between public education investment and household education expenditure, irrelavant, substitutive or complementary. The result shows that the increase of public education investment leads to an increase in individual education investment,
which is also called the crowd-in effect. Generally speaking, public education investment has a crowd-in effect on family education investment. That is, the increase in public education investment leads to an increase in individual education investment. Second, it shows
a more crowd-in effect on urban family education investment, especially when the children are having compulsory education.
